# Contributing

Fork the repo, make a branch off of the `dev` branch. Then, when you're ready, create a merge request from your feature branch into the `dev` branch of _this_ repo. Then, you can either wait for a review or ping us on Discord to let us know you have something for us to look at. When merging into `dev`, don't include a rebuilt version of the DLL, we'll rebuild the DLL when we make a new release. Thanks!
